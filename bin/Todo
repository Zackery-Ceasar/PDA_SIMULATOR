    Main will be in charge of reading in the file from argument and passing to
    PDA_SIM will be in charge of overhead class handling and functionality, it will pass
    the file to a States class which will read in the states and a Transition class which will
    read and store our transitions
    First step is reading in from input file
    There are two types of input files, state and transition

    PDA_Sim will contain:
        load()
        simulate()
        output_results()

    State lines come in as:
        state x start
        state x accept
        state x accept  start
        state x start accept

        x can be any number between 0 and 1000

    Transition lines come in as:
        transition p x y q z

        p - Current state
        x - What we are reading
        y - What we are popping
        q - Next state
        z - What we are pushing

        We begin at start state and check what configurations we
        can move to by comparing current configuration and possible transitions. If
        the following is true we add the configurations:

        1.
        Current input symbol in config = read symbol of transition
        AND
        Whats on top of the stack in config = pop symbol of transition

        2.
        read symbol of transition = Epsilon (Empty state)
        AND
        Whats on top of the stack in config = pop symbol of transition

        3.
        Current input symbol in config = read symbol of transition
        AND
        pop symbol of transition = Epsilon (Empty state)

        4.
        read symbol of transition = Epsilon (Empty state)
        AND
        pop symbol of transition = Epsilon (Empty state)


        Whats required:
            - Some sort of Data Structure to hold the configurations and transitions
                We can have a configurations class and transitions class and then maintain them
                inside our PDA_SIM file
            - Some sort of Data Structure to map each configuration to each possible transition
            - A way to check to see if a configuration has been created already, to avoid infite loops
            - We should also maintain lists of which configurations are accepted vs. rejected
                - If none of the terminal configurations have an accept state or there are no terminal
                    configurations we reject.
                - If there exists a terminal configuration which is an accept state, we accept.

            Once the configurations are generated, we check to see if any are terminal congurations with accept states.
